SPAWN TELEPRESENCE ROBOTS

https://sp4wn.com

A platform where you can share access to your telepresence robot without worrying about networking/communication protocols. Just build your bot, flash our code onto your microcontroller, and you're ready to go! Tutorial coming soon. **Please note that webRTC is currently not functioning properly on iOS.

Simply flash the esp32 using the arduino IDE at 115200 baud rate then you should be able to connect it to your web browser on sp4wn.com either before or after going live. I used an l293d to control the motors. Video tutorial coming soon.
