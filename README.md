ESP32:
v0_robot:
Simply flash the esp32 using the arduino IDE at 115200 baud rate then you should be able to connect it to your web browser on sp4wn.com either before or after going live. I used an l293d to control the motors. 

CameraWebServer: 
This turns your ESP32 into an IP camera. To use this on the website you'll need to run the web page locally when setting the video source or convert it into an HTTPS server. If you're able to get it working as an HTTPS server please let me know. I haven't looked into it much yet.
