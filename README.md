A platform where you can share access to your telepresence robot without worrying about networking/communication protocols. Just build your bot, flash our code onto your microcontroller, and you're ready to go!  **Please note that webRTC may not be functioning properly on iOS. -Currently supporting the following robot types: phone + esp32 || Raspberry Pi

## Features:

- Quick and easy setup (no coding required)  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We provide all the code necessary to get your bot up and running. You will need to handle setting it up such as installing required packages.
- Charge for access to your robot (tokens/min)  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- i.e. Peer A sets the number of tokens per minute for their robot. Peer B is charged the rate/min every minute until they disconnect. Turn telepresence robots into income-generating assets.
- Modifiable code to handle input controls (gamepads/controllers are supported)  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- i.e. Peer A shares access to their robot. Peer B controls the robot with a controller. Peer A's robot can interpret the "A" button press however they'd like (move servo to position, execute function, etc.)
- A store where you can buy telepresence robots either designed by us or by the community.
