## Instructions
After setting up your robot using our scripts in the Robots directory, navigate to https://spawn-vr.onrender.com on the Oculus browser. 

For testing, open two browser tabs: [Robot-UI](https://robot-csyy.onrender.com) and [VR-UI](https://spawn-vr.onrender.com). Install the WebXR Chrome extension and open the developer tools to simulate the 3D immersive environment.

### Create accounts
- On [Spawn](https://sp4wn.com), create at least one account for your robot.

### VR login
- You'll be automatically logged in as a guest, but you're welcome to log in with your username and password. Enter your robot's username and then click the "Spawn" button to connect to your robot.

### VR tips
- In the Oculus browser, navigate to your VR-UI or use our portal [spawn-vr.onrender.com].
- You may need to re-enter VR mode if you see a black screen.
